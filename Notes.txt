****Understand Web Interactions****

Difference between HTTP and HTTPS
->Scenario
Suppose you want to send a letter through post office. The first thing you will do is:-
    (i)Write a letter(Message) -> Request
    (ii)Address -> URL
    (iii)When the letter is arrived to your friend(Reply) -> Response
This is how web browser talks to website

HTTP -> Hyper text transfer protocol(This is the language which is used by the browser to talk to the website)
(Basically it is a type of rule which browser and website follows to understand each other)
                            +
                        Security

HTTPS -> Hyper text transfer protocol secure(It means the data which you will provide to the website will be secure. No other person would be able to steal your data)


->What is URL
Uniform resourse locator. Suppose you want to go on a specific page.
https://www.amazon.com/products
https://www.amazon.com/products/laptop

->Summary
Restaurant -> Website
You -> Browser(Client)
Restaurant address -> URL
Waiter -> Request
Kitchen -> Server
Cook -> Backend code
Meal -> Response
Bill / Receipt -> Status code

->Final Summary
HTTP/HTTPS -> Rules for communication between browser and Server
Request -> Your browser asking for something(a page, data)
Response -> The server's reply with what you asked for
Status codes -> A code that tells you if the request worked or failed
Browser -> The software you use to access websites
URL -> The address of a webpage
Server -> The computer that stores and runs the website

->Why Python alone is not sufficient??
(i)Python alone cannot talk to a browser.
(Suppose you want to print Hello World you can easily do that but if you want to showcase it onto a web page than you have to figure out many things(Manual Connection creation, How browser is sending the message))
(ii)There are no buttons, pages and login forms in python.
(iii)You have to build everything from the scratch(even for a simple form)


****First Phase****
(i)app = Flask(__name__) # We have created object as "app" name. This object will represent our website.
# __name__ -> It will tell flask that this is our main flask file

(ii)@app.route("/") # @ -> It is called as route decorator. It is telling flask that whenever someone tries to visit home page, whatever we will do below it you have to run that code

(iii)Meaning of app.route -> Basically it is used to read a specific web page or a function

(iv)Meaning of "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
--http:// -> Communication protocol used to talk between browser and web server
--127.0.0.1 -> IP address of our computer(Local Host)
--5000 -> Port number where your flask is runnning

(v)We can create multiple web pages through app.route like home page, contact us page. For example:-
    @app.route("/")
    def home():
        return "Hello user! This is my first flask app"

    @app.route("/about")
    def about():
        return "This is about us page"

    @app.route("/contact")
    def contact():
        return("This is a contact us page")

This tells user whenever you visit homepage you will get this message "Hello user! This is my first flask app" and on about us page "This is about us page". Similarly on contact us page "This is a contact us page".

(vi)app.route -> Pages must be unique, readable and every function must return something.
