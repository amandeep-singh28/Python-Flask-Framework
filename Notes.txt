****Understand Web Interactions****

Difference between HTTP and HTTPS
->Scenario
Suppose you want to send a letter through post office. The first thing you will do is:-
    (i)Write a letter(Message) -> Request
    (ii)Address -> URL
    (iii)When the letter is arrived to your friend(Reply) -> Response
This is how web browser talks to website

HTTP -> Hyper text transfer protocol(This is the language which is used by the browser to talk to the website)
(Basically it is a type of rule which browser and website follows to understand each other)
                            +
                        Security

HTTPS -> Hyper text transfer protocol secure(It means the data which you will provide to the website will be secure. No other person would be able to steal your data)


->What is URL
Uniform resourse locator. Suppose you want to go on a specific page.
https://www.amazon.com/products
https://www.amazon.com/products/laptop

->Summary
Restaurant -> Website
You -> Browser(Client)
Restaurant address -> URL
Waiter -> Request
Kitchen -> Server
Cook -> Backend code
Meal -> Response
Bill / Receipt -> Status code

->Final Summary
HTTP/HTTPS -> Rules for communication between browser and Server
Request -> Your browser asking for something(a page, data)
Response -> The server's reply with what you asked for
Status codes -> A code that tells you if the request worked or failed
Browser -> The software you use to access websites
URL -> The address of a webpage
Server -> The computer that stores and runs the website

->Why Python alone is not sufficient??
(i)Python alone cannot talk to a browser.
(Suppose you want to print Hello World you can easily do that but if you want to showcase it onto a web page than you have to figure out many things(Manual Connection creation, How browser is sending the message))
(ii)There are no buttons, pages and login forms in python.
(iii)You have to build everything from the scratch(even for a simple form)
