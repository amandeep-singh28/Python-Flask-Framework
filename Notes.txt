****Understand Web Interactions****

Difference between HTTP and HTTPS
->Scenario
Suppose you want to send a letter through post office. The first thing you will do is:-
    (i)Write a letter(Message) -> Request
    (ii)Address -> URL
    (iii)When the letter is arrived to your friend(Reply) -> Response
This is how web browser talks to website

HTTP -> Hyper text transfer protocol(This is the language which is used by the browser to talk to the website)
(Basically it is a type of rule which browser and website follows to understand each other)
                            +
                        Security

HTTPS -> Hyper text transfer protocol secure(It means the data which you will provide to the website will be secure. No other person would be able to steal your data)


->What is URL
Uniform resourse locator. Suppose you want to go on a specific page.
https://www.amazon.com/products
https://www.amazon.com/products/laptop

->Summary
Restaurant -> Website
You -> Browser(Client)
Restaurant address -> URL
Waiter -> Request
Kitchen -> Server
Cook -> Backend code
Meal -> Response
Bill / Receipt -> Status code

->Final Summary
HTTP/HTTPS -> Rules for communication between browser and Server
Request -> Your browser asking for something(a page, data)
Response -> The server's reply with what you asked for
Status codes -> A code that tells you if the request worked or failed
Browser -> The software you use to access websites
URL -> The address of a webpage
Server -> The computer that stores and runs the website

->Why Python alone is not sufficient??
(i)Python alone cannot talk to a browser.
(Suppose you want to print Hello World you can easily do that but if you want to showcase it onto a web page than you have to figure out many things(Manual Connection creation, How browser is sending the message))
(ii)There are no buttons, pages and login forms in python.
(iii)You have to build everything from the scratch(even for a simple form)


****First Phase****
(i)app = Flask(__name__) # We have created object as "app" name. This object will represent our website.
# __name__ -> It will tell flask that this is our main flask file

(ii)@app.route("/") # @ -> It is called as route decorator. It is telling flask that whenever someone tries to visit home page, whatever we will do below it you have to run that code

(iii)Meaning of app.route -> Basically it is used to read a specific web page or a function

(iv)Meaning of "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
--http:// -> Communication protocol used to talk between browser and web server
--127.0.0.1 -> IP address of our computer(Local Host)
--5000 -> Port number where your flask is runnning

(v)We can create multiple web pages through app.route like home page, contact us page. For example:-
    @app.route("/")
    def home():
        return "Hello user! This is my first flask app"

    @app.route("/about")
    def about():
        return "This is about us page"

    @app.route("/contact")
    def contact():
        return("This is a contact us page")

This tells user whenever you visit homepage you will get this message "Hello user! This is my first flask app" and on about us page "This is about us page". Similarly on contact us page "This is a contact us page".

(vi)app.route -> Pages must be unique, readable and every function must return something.

->HTTPS Method(Get and Post)
(i)Get
Where you get some information.
(I want some information)
(ii)Post
Where you want to submit some information.
(I am sending some data process it)

->>Syntax in flask -- How to use Get and Post
@app.route("/submit, methods = ["GET", "POST"])
def submit():
    if request.method == "POST":
        return "You sent data!"
    else:
        return "You are just viewing the form."

->>Terminology
(i)request -> Read what the user sends {request.form["name"] from a form}

(ii)response -> Send something back to the user {return Response(), Flask will automatically wrap this into a response object and send it back to the user}
For example:- You go on a bakery and ask for a break and the shopkeeper give it you(Simple)

(iii)redirect -> Move the user to a different page{redirect("/thankyou")}

(iv)url_for -> Build a route dynamicaly from function name (It builds a full url to a specific function or a specific page inside your app) {url_for("home") -> "/home"}
For example:-
Suppose you want to go your friend house, instead of saying the address like this (123 Gupta Nagar 3rd room B-12). If you will say like this than no one will be able to understand. If you will say "mujhe Sharma ji ke ghr jana hai" than everyone will understand it.
So basically, system will found full_address for you. There are three reasons for using this:-
    (i)You don't have to learn urls
    (ii)If your url is changed than it will work there also(url_for())
    (iii)Url is broken(It will save you from that also)

(v)sessions -> Remember user info across pages
It is built-in dictionary which remembers information about one user across the pages.
For example:-
Suppose you go on a shopping mall and you are a regular customer. Mall employess suggested you that you can take membership card which will benefit you. So, whenever you will go on shopping after taking the membership, system will know automatically that you are a premium memeber of our mall.
(If a user is logging in, their name must be remembered, in the amazon cart also, whenever you put items in the cart it remembers you that you have put it something inside the cart)


****Second Phase:- Building Dynamic Web Pages****
Suppose you are creating a website for a school. Suppose you want to showcase the result of students whenever a student login into the website.
(Hello Amit. You are a class topper)
There will be other students also other than Amit. So, you will not create 1000s of html file to complete this task. This is where JINJA templates takes command.

->What is JINJA template??
It is a tool in which you can use it to showcase python variables in the html pages

(i)Python values
{{ variable }}
{{ name }}
For example:
<p> Welcome {{name}} </p>

(ii)Conditionals
{% if %}...{% endif %}
For example:
is_topper = True
{% if is_topper %}
    <p> You are a topper </p>
{% else %}
    <p> You need to work hard </p>
{% endif %}

->Template Inheritance
Suppose you are making a website in which there are multiple pages (about us, contact us, etc). If this is a website than the layout will be same for other pages also.
Header and footer will be same for all other pages. The only change will be content, if you are in about us page than other content, contact us page than some other content.
If you are coding without Inheritance than you have to create the same layout for every page which will increase the code.

--Write some code in the base file
--Use that base file in other child classes
--In the child file use extends(It will know than you are using the code from base.html file)

->>Syntax
(i)base.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{% block title %} My Website {% endblock %}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>....</header>
        {% block content %}
            <!--=====Start Section=====-->

            <!--=====End Section=====-->
        {% endblock %}

    <footer>....</footer>
</body>
</html>

(ii)Child class
{% extends "base.html"}

{% block content %}
<h1>This is home page</h1>
{% endblock %}
